## Smart Traffic Management System

In an era marked by rapid urbanization and technological advancement, cities worldwide are facing mounting challenges related to traffic congestion and transportation efficiency. As populations grow and vehicle numbers increase, urban road networks are becoming increasingly saturated, leading to longer travel times, heightened air pollution, and compromised public safety. The inefficiency of traditional traffic management systems—often based on fixed timing schedules and lacking real-time adaptability—exacerbates these problems, resulting in frequent bottlenecks and delayed emergency interventions. 

Moreover, the rising demand for sustainable urban mobility calls for smarter, more responsive traffic solutions that can dynamically adjust to fluctuating traffic patterns and prioritize critical vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks. The integration of emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and computer vision offers promising avenues to revolutionize how cities manage traffic flow and enhance overall urban living conditions.
